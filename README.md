TouchDesigner OpenSoure Projects
================================

## Introduction

Hi, this is a collection of TouchDesigner projects that I've created for various purposes.

I've included a README.md file for each project, which will give you a brief overview of what the project is about.

If you are interested in Point Cloud in TouchDesigner, these projects may be helpful:

- [AnimalPointCloud](AnimalPointCloud/README.md)
- [DepthMapToPointCloud](DepthMapToPointCloud/README.md)

If you are interested in PCG in TouchDesigner, these projects may be helpful:

- [InstanceStructure](InstanceStructure/README.md)
- [Phyllotaxis](Phyllotaxis/README.md)
- [ProcedureFlowers](ProcedureFlowers/README.md)
- [CreateNormals](CreateNormals/README.md)

Here are also some algorithm implementation examples:

- [BoidSimulation](BoidSimulation/README.md)
- [Quadtree](Quadtree/README.md)
- [SlimeSimulation](SliMESimulation/README.md)

Ragarding the power of shader (glsl in TouchDesigner), there are some examples:

- [ParticleStatue](ParticleStatue/README.md)
- [CosmicR](CosmicR/README.md)

Feel free to use those knowledge in your projects !
