**Article in [ZhiHu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/496553984)**

Basic Phyllotaxis is part of the LSystem, I use the SOP in TouchDesigner to generate the phyllotaxis pattern.

With the geometry data, I made the points into the particles' emitters. 

You can control the pattern's changing using the simple UI on the top.
