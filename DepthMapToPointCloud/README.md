Images to Point Cloud using depth map generated from a AI tool
==============================================================

In this project, we use the depth map generated from a AI tool to generate a point cloud. 

The original photos were collected from the internet.

### Depth map
Actually, there are many AI processing method to generate the depth map like this. In this project, I use [MiDaS v2](https://pytorch.org/hub/intelisl_midas_v2/) to generate the depth maps.

### Point Cloud
In touchDesigner, we can easily generate a point cloud from the depth map like this. With some post-processing or animations, we can get a better result.
