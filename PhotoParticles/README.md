GurlNoise using glsl in Touchdesigner
=====================================

This is a project following one of the most classic touchDesigner's tutorails ---- [GurlNoise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkSwEY-m9GA&t=442s), made by [threedashes](https://www.youtube.com/@threedashes___) 

I use the instance tool in Touchdesigner to create a set of picture particles with the curl noise glsl compute shader.
